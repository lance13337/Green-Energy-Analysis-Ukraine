Analysis of green energy production and consumption in Ukraine in 2017-2021

The "Green Energy Analysis Ukraine" project focuses on analyzing the production of energy from renewable sources in Ukraine over the period 2017-2021. In the modern world, where issues of energy security and the efficient use of natural resources are becoming increasingly important, analyzing energy production is highly relevant. Renewable energy sources, such as biogas, biomass, wind power plants (WPP), hydroelectric power plants (HPP), and solar power plants (SPP), play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring sustainable development.
